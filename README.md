# Reversi

* This was a project to make an Othello/Reversi GUI using Java and JFrame
* Currently the last available is the one selected by the PC for play
* Note: This could be optimized by using a min max algorithm

The game starts with a board that moves a black piece for the computer first
The user is then prompted to play with their corresponding white piece
